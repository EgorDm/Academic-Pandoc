# Introduction

ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent LaTeX style for use across ACM publications, and incorporates
accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality necessary for future
Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and SIG-specific LaTeX templates
have been examined, and their unique features incorporated into this
single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable guide
to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you have
published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The "`acmart`" document class can be used to prepare articles for any
ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage of
publication, from review to final "camera-ready" copy, to the author's
own version, with *very* few changes to the source.

# Template Overview

As noted in the introduction, the "`acmart`" document class can be used
to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a double-blind
initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a two-page SIGGRAPH
Emerging Technologies abstract, a "camera-ready" journal article, a
SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by selecting the appropriate
*template style* and *template parameters*.

This document will explain the major features of the document class. For
further information, the *LaTeX User's Guide* is available from
